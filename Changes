 -  Fix test errors caused by Perl::Tidy::perltidy v20121207
            no longer vertically aligning "=~".  Test::PerlTidy now
            requires Perl::Tidy::perltidy >= v20121207.

20120621     2012-06-21

 -  Fix errors caused by Perl::Tidy::perltidy now disallowing
            a scalar reference as the "stderr" option.

20120621     2012-06-21

 -  Some cleanup:

 1) MANIFEST was missing t/_perltidyrc.txt

 2) Updated build instructions in README

 3) Updated .gitignore

    -  Add dependency on "parent" for CPANTESTERS

20110320     2011-03-20

 -  Resolve several open bugs and feature requests:

 1) Allow specifying top-level path to start search for files to test
    (instead of always using ".").

 2) Allow specifying a perltidyrc file to test against.

 3) Allow specifying files or directories to exclude from testing.

 4) Fix so distribution passes its own tidyness tests.

20080429     2008-04-29

    -  A file is tidy wrt a version of Perl::Tidy
            (even Test::PerlTidy fell prey to this subtle issue)

    -  Added File::Finder as a prereq
            Changed the META.yml file to be valid YAML
